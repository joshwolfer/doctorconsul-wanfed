# HashiCorp "Doctor" Consul Environment

This repo is a clone from [Doctor Consul](https://github.com/joshwolfer/doctorconsul). It takes a subset from the original repo and configures it with WAN federation instead of cluster peering.

The goal is to build a test environment to prove if it's possible to migrate from WAN Fed to cluster peering.
